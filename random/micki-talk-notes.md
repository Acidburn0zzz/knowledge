# Micki - Systems are Sexy

_This was talk was given at Hacker Paradise on January 19th, by Micki. Here are some very rough notes._

## Notes

### Benefits
- Free up brain space
- Takes tasks off your to-do list
- Makes clients feel cared for
- Scalabale

- Hit the max

### Making Money is Killing your business
- working on your business will prevent burnout _This is true! I love working on making it better, not so much working in it_.

### 5 Step Plan

1. **Acts of Freedom**. List every task you do, and mark keep it, or delegate it.

  Make a simple spreadsheet: Task, Deadline for transition, Person, 3rd party...

2. **Identify**. who you need to hire/outsource, and set deadlines or benchmarks for those.
3. **Process map**. Write out your processes A-Z

  Living document. As dumbed down as possible. Make it so that someone else can read it.

4. **Automate** these processes.

  Contactually. Also lead generation. Find a good pipeline program.

5. **Revisit #1** until you're only doing high dollar or enjoyable tasks.

#### Result

You want to be able to take 30 days off and survive.

### Why most people never get this far:

- Research and testing tools
- Setup to impelmeneting new tools
- Getting people to use tools

Overcoming obstacles:
- Keep it simple
- Make sure you're meeting a need or fixing a problem, instead of adding new requirements

> "Honestly, simply the result of setting my intention with my business."

- It's clear what tasks I need to do each day.
- Only work 3 days a week on your business.

### Next Steps

- get started:
  - Set aside some time to identify what your biggest stressors are. 
  - Pick one thing, even if it is small, then research solutions and try one.
  - Don't do it alone!


## Doubts
- I am not good at following up, even now.
- I don't make people feel cared for.
- You should have a database of 600 clients/providers
- What's your goal?

## To Do

- Make a spreadsheet of tasks you do
- Make a client database. Follow up with them until they don't respond or negatively respond.
