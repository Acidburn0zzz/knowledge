# How To Write GitHub Issues

GitHub issues are crucial to the development process of open source teams using GitHub. GitHub is not just a place for storing versioned copies of code; it is a social network, where different people can contribute to different code easily. The socializing almost never happens in the code itself; it happens in the issues and in the pull requests. Without them, GitHub would be little more than a server storing code, and we’d be stuck discussing software changes over email. 

Because of how GitHub works, it is crucial to learn how to use issues efficiently. Issues are where you communicate your bugs, feature requests, questions, concerns, or any other comments regarding a code base. Making it easier for others to understand you will level up your skill as a programmer, and cut down on development time for the whole team. 

Here, we’ll cover a few different kinds of issues:

— Bugs
— Feature Requests
— General questions
— Security concerns
— Meta questions
