# todo

This is my public to do list. Things in here aren't necessarily on my immediate to do list (which I keep private, for obvious reasons), but they may be scoped such that I can have them publicly available.

If you would like to add a To Do for me, please [take a look at RichardLitt/todo!](https://github.com/RichardLitt/todo).
