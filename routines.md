# Routines

### Cafes

- Never go to a cafe where this is a fly problem. No matter how nice the coffee is, you will never get into flow when there are flies landing on you.

### Talks

Before a talk, say this:

> I will not denigrate or insult myself during the talk. I will not downplay my tool. I will not call myself or my content boring. I will just assume that people are interested, and not see a quiet room as a disinterested room.
