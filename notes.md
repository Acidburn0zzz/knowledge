# Notes
> A personal list of things that are useful to remember, code wise.

To use best, I suggest setting up this alias in `.bash_profile`:

```sh
  alias notes="subl ~/src/docs/notes.md"
```

As always, use your favorite text editor and adjust the path.

## IRC

### Tell
To remind someone later, use: `.tell <user> <message>`.
